//! What a recovered artifact's classification states.
//!
//! `ADR-0003` defines six confidence levels. `ADR-0014` section 3 records
//! that three of them have no reachable code path in this tool, that one
//! misdescribes the case it would be assigned to, and that one of M8's
//! three validator outcomes has no level at all. `ADR-0014` Decision E
//! implements only what is reachable, on `ADR-0003` section 8's reasoning
//! that implementing a level no code path can produce is speculative.
//!
//! This module is filesystem-independent, as `validation` is. A level
//! states how content was obtained and says nothing about FAT32. It is
//! kept apart from `validation` because `ADR-0003` section 5 and
//! `SAFETY.md` section 14 require the two axes not be merged: this module
//! says how the bytes were obtained, `validation` says what comparing them
//! against a reference established.
