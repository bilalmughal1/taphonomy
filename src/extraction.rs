//! Writing a recovered artifact: the part of ADR-0015 that does not depend
//! on which filesystem the bytes came from.
//!
//! [`ArtifactWriter`] takes the artifact's bytes in whatever pieces the
//! caller has them, hashes every one, and, where a destination was asked
//! for, writes the same bytes in the same pass. The file is created with
//! `create_new`, flushed, closed and read back, and a partial file left by
//! a failed read is removed. A filesystem's recovery code decides which
//! bytes make up the artifact and in what order; it does not reimplement
//! any of this.
//!
//! # Which failures stop a run
//!
//! ADR-0015 Decision G. A read failure in the evidence voids the
//! extraction: the hasher did not see every byte, so there is no digest and
//! the caller calls [`ArtifactWriter::abort`]. A failure on the destination
//! does not. The run read the evidence and hashed it, and a full disk says
//! nothing about the evidence, so the digest is reported together with a
//! statement that nothing was delivered. Everything in [`Output`] is a
//! statement about the destination.
