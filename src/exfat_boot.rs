//! The exFAT boot region: choosing a region, checking it, and reading the
//! volume's geometry from it.
//!
//! ADR-0019 section 3. The main boot region is used if its checksum is valid
//! and every field is within the range the specification gives it; otherwise
//! the backup region, if the same holds; otherwise the volume is not
//! analysed. A volume with two FATs is TexFAT (specification section 3.1.16),
//! which is identified and not analysed.
//!
//! Every field here is untrusted evidence. The sector size, which decides how
//! many bytes the region occupies, is read from sector 0 before anything else
//! and is range checked before it is used to size a read. Nothing in this
//! module reads a FAT, a directory or the allocation bitmap.
//!
//! The specification's section numbers are cited beside each rule. Where the
//! specification states one bound twice, in two fields' ranges, a single
//! check enforces it and says so.
//!
//! `PartitionOffset` (section 3.1.4) is not read: every value is valid and 0
//! means "ignore", so a disagreement with the partition table is not a
//! finding.
