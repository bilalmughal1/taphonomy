//! What a run reports about its own coverage.
//!
//! `ADR-0014` Appendix B.5 derives a coverage status from what the run did
//! not analyse, and Appendix B.10 exits non-zero where it analysed nothing.
//! Neither is observable from the library: both are decisions the binary
//! makes once, over a whole run, so they are asserted against the binary.
//!
//! `tests/cli_arguments.rs` covers the three states through the exit status.
//! This suite covers what the block says, the kinds of gap that reach it,
//! and the one gap no fixture holds.
//!
//! The tests use the generated fixtures, which are not committed. Run
//! `./scripts/generate-fixtures.sh` first.
