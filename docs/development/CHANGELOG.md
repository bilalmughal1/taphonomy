## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Read-only evidence file access with SHA-256 hashing (ADR-0002 M1)
- CLI reporting evidence path, reported size, bytes read, and digest
- SHA-256 verification against NIST FIPS 180-4 vectors (ADR-0004 §5.5)
- Evidence immutability tests covering permissions, mtime, and contents
- MBR partition table parser with bounds validation against evidence size
  (ADR-0002 M2, ADR-0005)
- GPT protective MBR detection, reported as unsupported rather than parsed
  (ADR-0005 §4)
- Deterministic synthetic fixture generation for partition parsing
- Positional evidence reads via `EvidenceFile::read_exact_at`
- Filesystem identification from volume boot record structure (ADR-0002 M3)
- FAT variant determined by data-region cluster count per the FAT
  specification, not by the advisory type string at offset 0x52
- Detection of disagreement between declared MBR partition type and observed
  filesystem
- exFAT and NTFS recognised and reported as unsupported
- Partition anomalies and filesystem observations reported as readable
  text rather than debug-formatted structures
- FAT32 boot sector parsing validated against the partition extent
  (ADR-0002 M4)
- Detection of a volume declaring more sectors than its partition holds,
  a root directory cluster outside the data region, and a file allocation
  table too small for the clusters declared
- Reporting of a hidden sector count that records a start the volume does
  not have
- FAT32 boot sector detail reported by the CLI, including root cluster,
  backup boot sector location, FAT mirroring state, and volume label
- Rejection of an active FAT index at or beyond the declared FAT count
- FAT32 root directory enumeration by cluster chain walk (ADR-0002 M5,
  ADR-0008)
- Directory entry classification covering the volume label, 8.3 names,
  long-name components, and the attribute combination the specification
  names invalid
- Long-name entries retained in on-disk order and counted, not decoded
  (ADR-0007 §5)
- Cluster chain links read from the active FAT rather than from FAT 0
  unconditionally (ADR-0008 §4)
- Reporting of non-zero content found after a directory terminator, which
  a conformant volume does not contain (ADR-0008 §5)
- Refusal of a cyclic cluster chain, a chain link outside the data region,
  and a directory exceeding the specification's maximum size
- Root directory contents reported by the CLI, including the cluster chain
  and the position of every entry
- Deleted directory entry identification (ADR-0002 M6, ADR-0009)
- Classification of what a deleted entry was, with the fields deletion
  destroys omitted rather than computed, so that a destroyed long-name
  ordinal cannot be read as a valid one (ADR-0009 §3, EXP-0003 §4)
- Recovery of a short name's destroyed first byte from the checksum a
  surviving long-name entry carries, which determines it rather than
  narrowing it (ADR-0007 Appendix C, ADR-0009 §6.1)
- Rejection of a long-name association whose recovered byte is one a live
  entry never holds, which proves the set belongs to another entry
  (ADR-0009 §6.2)
- Entries beyond a directory terminator classified and reported separately
  from the allocated listing, rather than counted (ADR-0008 §5,
  ADR-0009 §4)
- Deleted entry count reported by the CLI alongside the short and long-name
  counts
- Fixtures carrying deleted 8.3 entries, a complete long-name set, a
  partial one left by slot reuse, a removed subdirectory, and entries past
  a terminator (ADR-0006 §5.1, ADR-0009 §8)
- Measurement of what mtools deletion destroys and leaves, and of what a
  fixture built with it can and cannot prove (EXP-0003)
- Recovery of the data of an unfragmented deleted file in the FAT32 root
  directory, extracted to memory and reported as a digest with the number
  of bytes it covers (ADR-0002 M7, ADR-0010)
- Refusal of a recovery whose implied cluster run reaches a cluster the
  active FAT reports as in use, naming the cluster that caused it
  (ADR-0010 §5)
- Eligibility reported as named refusals rather than silence, covering a
  deleted directory, a volume label, a long-name component, the invalid
  attribute pair, a zero size, a reserved first cluster, and a run
  extending past the last data cluster (ADR-0010 §6)
- Extraction streamed one cluster at a time, so memory does not scale with
  a size read from evidence; file slack is read, excluded from the digest,
  and its size reported (ADR-0010 §7)
- A project-owned incremental SHA-256 hasher, with `hash_reader` written
  over it so one implementation does the hashing (ADR-0010 §8)
- `--recover`, placing the reading of a deleted file's content behind an
  explicit request; without it the implied run and its allocation status
  are reported and no content is read (ADR-0010 §4)
- Fixtures carrying a four-cluster deleted file with its run intact, a
  single-cluster deleted file, a deleted directory, and a poked size whose
  implied run reaches a cluster a live file holds (ADR-0006 §5.1,
  ADR-0010 §10)
- Validation of recovered content against a digest the operator supplies,
  reported as a match or a difference alongside the number of bytes
  compared (ADR-0002 M8, ADR-0013)
- `--reference-digest`, accepting 64 hexadecimal characters in either case
  and rejecting everything else, including a pasted `sha256sum` line whose
  trailing filename would otherwise be discarded in silence (ADR-0013 §6.1)
- A reference that cannot be read stopping the run before any evidence is
  opened, which is the only condition M8 fails closed on (ADR-0013 §3.4)
- A reference supplied without `--recover` reported as an argument error
  rather than implying a flag that reads content (ADR-0013 Decision H)
- A differing digest reported as a finding about the evidence rather than a
  failed operation, so the run continues and the exit status is zero
  (ADR-0013 §3)
- The four conditions a differing digest is consistent with, enumerated
  without one of them being chosen (ADR-0013 Decision E)
- The limit of a match stated alongside it: byte equality with what was
  supplied, which establishes less where the content is not distinctive
  (ADR-0013 §8.2)
- `Sha256Digest::from_hex`, which reads a recorded digest and computes none
  (ADR-0013 §6.2)
- A `validation` module that compares digests, reads no evidence and names
  no filesystem structure, keeping validation separate from extraction
  (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §5.6, ADR-0013 §11)
- Command-line argument handling covered by tests that run the binary,
  including that two of its checks precede opening the evidence
  (ADR-0013 §16)
- A fixture holding a deleted file whose three clusters were not adjacent,
  with the clusters between its fragments freed as well, built with
  `mtools` alone and containing no poked field (EXP-0004)
- Measurement of incorrect recovery on that fixture: three of its five
  deleted entries recover content that is not their own file's, and the
  tool reports all five identically (`CLAUDE.md` §26)
- A confidence level carried by a reconstructed artifact and reported once
  per run, the only level `ADR-0003`'s model leaves reachable for this tool
  (ADR-0002 M9, ADR-0014 Decision A)
- A coverage statement reporting what a run did not analyse, as a count per
  kind of gap and a status of complete, incomplete or none (ADR-0014
  Appendix B.5)
- A directory that was listed and not read counted as a gap, live or
  deleted, which four fixtures hold and no run previously reported
  (ADR-0014 Appendix B.2)
- Counts of the deleted entries that produced no artifact, by what stopped
  each one, so that an operator knows which questions went unanswered
  (ADR-0013 Appendix C.4)
- Artifact and comparison counts reported for the run rather than per
  entry, which `ADR-0003` §4.7 requires of a session (ADR-0014 Appendix B.8)
- `--output <directory>`, writing each recovered artifact to a file named
  from the entry's slot and first cluster, so no byte of evidence reaches
  the path (ADR-0015 Decisions A and D)
- Every directory the root reaches read: a live one along its cluster chain,
  a deleted one from its first cluster alone (ADR-0016 Decisions A and B)
- A deleted directory's first cluster read only where the FAT marks it free
  and it carries `.` naming that cluster and `..`, and reported with the
  check it failed otherwise (ADR-0016 Decision C)
- A listing that may continue beyond a deleted directory's first cluster
  counted as a coverage gap of its own kind, the thirteenth (ADR-0016
  Decision D)
- Bounds on the walk: no cluster read twice, and nothing deeper than 128
  levels below the root, each reported as a gap (ADR-0016 Decision E)
- Fixtures for a deleted subtree, a deleted directory whose clusters are not
  adjacent, 130 nested directories, a directory loop, and two deleted
  entries sharing a slot and a first cluster (EXP-0005, EXP-0006)
- Read-back verification of every written artifact: the file is re-opened,
  hashed, and reported as matching or differing from what was read, which
  states what landed rather than what was sent (ADR-0015 Decision H)
- Refusal of a destination holding the evidence, before the evidence is
  opened (ADR-0015 Decision B, corrected by its Appendix A)
- A twelfth coverage gap, for an artifact that was read and could not be
  handed to the operator (ADR-0015 section 9)
- A second fragmentation fixture, the same construction with the clusters
  between the fragments still allocated, on which the run the deleted entry
  implies reaches a live cluster and is refused rather than extracted. The
  refusal is reached with no poked field, where the existing collision
  fixture needs one (EXP-0004 Appendix A.5)
- A search, after the walk, of every data cluster the walk did not name,
  for a directory whose first entry names that cluster and whose FAT entry
  is free; each found is read under ADR-0016 Decision C and reported on its
  own with the cluster its `..` names (ADR-0017 Decisions A and B)
- The files an orphaned directory lists offered for recovery whether or not
  marked deleted, under a heading that does not call them deleted
  (ADR-0017 Decision C)
- A fourteenth coverage gap, for an orphan search an evidence error
  stopped, and a directory an orphaned listing names that the run never
  read counted as unread (ADR-0017 Decision D)
- Three fixtures: a quick-formatted DCF tree, the same volume written to
  once more, and a deleted tree deeper than the walk's bound with one dot
  entry broken (EXP-0007; ADR-0017 section 10)
- Continuous integration: on every push the fixtures are rebuilt on a clean
  runner and checked against the committed digests, then formatting, lint
  and the full test suite are run
- Validation against three NIST CFReDS deleted-file-recovery images and The
  Sleuth Kit (EXP-0008)

### Changed

- FAT BIOS parameter block parsing and variant determination moved from
  `filesystem.rs` into a dedicated `fat` module; `filesystem.rs` retains
  generic identification only
- `EntryKind::Deleted` carries what the surviving bytes establish the entry
  to have been; it previously carried nothing (ADR-0009 §3)
- `RootDirectory` carries the classified slots beyond the terminator; the
  observation reporting them is retained unchanged (ADR-0009 §4.4)
- `cluster_offset` and `read_fat_entry` widened from private to
  `pub(crate)`; neither moved (ADR-0010 §9)
- The in-memory `EvidenceReader` test double moved from `fat_directory.rs`
  into `evidence.rs`, where the trait it implements is declared, so both
  test modules share one rather than duplicating it (ADR-0010 Appendix C)
- The recovery digest line is labelled `recovered` and the comparison line
  `reference`, so the recovered-file hash and the validation hash are
  distinguishable wherever both appear (`docs/SAFETY.md` §10)
- A recovered artifact is named from the entry's own cluster as well as its
  slot and first cluster; a slot alone repeats in every directory cluster,
  so two entries could previously receive one name and the second be
  reported as a file that already existed (ADR-0016 Decision F)
- A destination that cannot be created is reported as not created; it was
  reported as a failure that had left a partial file behind, which an
  unwritable `--output` directory produced for every entry (ADR-0015
  Appendix B.1)
- A failed flush is a failed write: the file is removed and reported as not
  written, where it was reported as written and unverified (ADR-0015
  Appendix B.1)
- A partial file that survives an evidence failure is reported beside that
  failure; the removal's own failure was silent (ADR-0015 Appendix C)
- A partial file left by a failed write is removed when the evidence then
  fails too; only a file still open was removed (ADR-0015 Appendix B.1)
- Recovery caveats print once per volume rather than once per set of
  entries. On a volume holding a recoverable deleted entry past the
  directory terminator they previously appeared twice in one run
- The reporting functions take an options struct rather than a widening
  list of flags (ADR-0013 §13)
- A run that analysed nothing past the evidence digest exits 3. It
  previously exited 0 with nothing on standard output recording that
  nothing had been analysed (ADR-0014 Appendix B.10)
- Recovery caveats are computed from the run's counts rather than tracked
  separately alongside them, so the two cannot disagree (ADR-0014
  Appendix B.9)
- The free-run caveat says nothing has claimed the clusters since the entry
  lost them, where it said since deletion; an orphaned directory's files
  were never deleted
- A deleted directory's heading recovers its first character from the
  long-name component before it, as its entry in the listing already did;
  the two named one directory differently (EXP-0008)
