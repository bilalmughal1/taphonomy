# Taphonomy Known Issues

This document tracks known limitations, defects, and unresolved failure
modes in Taphonomy that have not yet been fixed, so that users and
contributors can distinguish an untested gap from a confirmed, documented
issue.

## No fixture exercises FAT mirroring

Every fixture writes `BPB_ExtFlags` as `0x0000`, meaning mirroring is
enabled and all FATs are maintained. Measured 2026-08-30:

```text
xxd -s $((1048576 + 0x28)) -l 2 -p fixtures/partition/mbr-single-fat32.img
  0000
```

`mkfs.vfat` offers no option to set the field. A fixture exercising the
mirroring-disabled path must poke `ExtFlags` and additionally make the
FATs differ, because `mkfs.vfat` writes them identically and a parser
reading FAT 0 would otherwise produce the same result as one reading
FAT 1.

`parse_boot_sector` validates the active FAT index against the declared
FAT count, and that check has unit coverage. Code that acts on the index
now exists: `enumerate_root` reads the FAT named by `BPB_ExtFlags` when
mirroring is disabled, and FAT 0 otherwise. It is covered by
`the_active_fat_is_read_when_mirroring_is_disabled`, which builds a volume
in memory with `ExtFlags` set to `0x0081`, a stale chain in FAT 0 and the
maintained chain in FAT 1.

What remains untested is the path against evidence a formatting tool
produced. No fixture reaches it, and none can until the fixture described
above exists.

## Long filename patent status unverified

Microsoft held patents on the VFAT long-filename mechanism and litigated
them. Their current status has not been researched. ADR-0007 section 5.5
records this as required before long-name decoding is implemented. It
does not affect enumeration, which counts long-name entries without
interpreting them.

## mdel determinism unmeasured

`EXPERIMENTS.md` EXP-0002 measured `mcopy` and, transitively, `mmd`.
Deleting a file with `mdel`, which M6 requires for deleted-entry
fixtures, has not been measured. It must be before M6 introduces them.
