# ADR-0019: exFAT, and What a Recovery From It May Claim

* **Status:** Accepted
* **Date:** 2026-09-26
* **Decision owners:** Taphonomy project
* **Scope:** Reading exFAT volumes, and recovering deleted files from them
* **Related:** `ADR-0002` §3.4, §3.5, §5.2; `ADR-0012`; `ADR-0018`;
  EXP-0009 and its Appendix A; Microsoft, *exFAT file system
  specification*, revision 1.00

---

## 1. Context

`ADR-0002` §5.2 made exFAT the correct second target, after FAT32's
concepts were established; §3.4 records that SD cards larger than 32 GB
use it. Taphonomy identifies exFAT today and does not analyse it.

EXP-0009 measured what Windows 10 leaves when it deletes from exFAT. The
entry set, the FAT chain and the data survive; only the InUse bits, the
bitmap and PercentInUse change. A deleted fragmented file can therefore be
followed by its own chain, which FAT32 never allows (`ADR-0002` §3.5).
The Sleuth Kit 4.15.0 does not do so.

EXP-0009 Appendix A then showed that intact metadata does not mean the
data is the file's. Of 118 deleted files whose metadata passed every
check, 16 held only zero bytes and 3 held another deleted file's data.

## 2. Decisions

* **A.** exFAT is the next filesystem, before FAT12, FAT16 and long names.
* **B.** A volume is analysed only from a boot region whose checksum is
  valid.
* **C.** An entry set is used only if its SetChecksum is valid; a deleted
  set, only with its InUse bits restored.
* **D.** A deleted file is recovered only when four conditions hold, and
  is otherwise refused with the condition it failed.
* **E.** A recovery states what was checked. It does not state that the
  data is the file's.
* **F.** Content past ValidDataLength is reported as zeros, never read.
* **G.** A volume is read, never mounted.

## 3. Reading the volume

The main boot region is used if its checksum (specification §3.4) is
valid; otherwise the backup region, if its checksum is valid, and the
report says so; otherwise the volume is reported and not analysed. A
volume with two FATs is TexFAT (§3.1.16) and is identified and not
analysed.

The root directory is always a FAT chain (§3.1.10). Other directories
follow their entry's NoFatChain flag (§6.3.4.2). A live entry set whose
SetChecksum (§6.3.3) is invalid is reported and not used. Names are read
from File Name entries; the up-case table is not needed, because nothing
is looked up by name.

---

## 4. Decision D: when a deleted file is recovered

A deleted entry set is a sequence of unused entries that, with the InUse
bit of each set again, forms a File entry set whose SetChecksum is valid.
Any other sequence is listed and not recovered.

Its allocation is read from its Stream Extension entry. With NoFatChain 1
it is one run of clusters, as many as DataLength needs. With NoFatChain 0
it is the chain from FirstCluster, which must stay within the cluster
heap, visit no cluster twice, end in `FFFFFFFFh` (§4.1.3), and be as many
clusters as DataLength needs.

It is recovered only if all of these hold:

1. every cluster of the allocation is free in the bitmap (§7.1.5);
2. no other deleted entry set that claims any of those clusters was
   created at the same time or later;
3. the data up to ValidDataLength is not zero bytes only;
4. the allocation is well formed, as above.

On EXP-0009's image B these conditions recover 99 files, each equal to
the file that was written, and refuse 19: 16 whose clusters hold only
zeros and 3 overwritten by a later file. Without conditions 2 and 3, the
same metadata would have recovered all 118.

Condition 2 uses creation time, including its 10 ms field. Equal times
refuse every file that shares them, because neither can be shown to be
the later.

## 5. Decision E: what a recovery claims

A recovered file is reported with the checks it passed: the entry set's
checksum, a free bitmap, a well-formed allocation, no later claim, and
content that is not only zeros. It is not reported as the file's data.
Appendix A shows why: data can be stale, or never written, while all of
its metadata is intact. Condition 3 detects only data that is zeros.

---

## 6. Acceptance

Before the exFAT code is merged:

1. On EXP-0009's image B, Taphonomy recovers exactly the 99 files
   Appendix A's last rule recovers, each equal by SHA-256 to the file
   written; refuses the 19 others with their conditions; refuses
   `FILL006.bin` for its allocated cluster; and lists the six
   `FILL233.bin` sets as holding no data.
2. `FRAG.bin` is among the 99, recovered by its chain.
3. On image A, every live file is listed and equal to the file written.
4. Every existing test passes, and output on every existing fixture is
   unchanged, compared by digest as in `ADR-0018` §5.

A public claim about exFAT recovery also needs NIST's exFAT
deleted-file-recovery images measured, as EXP-0008 did for FAT.

## 7. Not decided here

* **Fixtures.** `mtools` cannot write exFAT, so `ADR-0006`'s method does
  not carry over. How tests get exFAT volumes, and whether EXP-0009's
  images, 54 KB compressed, become test inputs, is decided before code.
* **Stale data other than zeros.** Condition 3 does not detect it.
  EXP-0010 measures a deleted fragmented file whose contiguous reading
  stays inside the volume.
* **Other deleting systems.** Cameras, phones, macOS and Linux were not
  measured.
* **Physical devices.** Reading a card directly, and what Windows writes
  when one is inserted, is phase 2 of EXP-0009.
* **Distribution in a paid product.** The engine is published under
  `ADR-0012`. Whether a commercial product may include exFAT support
  awaits a patent opinion; it does not affect the engine.
