//! FAT directory entries and FAT32 root directory enumeration.
//!
//! # What is shared and what is not
//!
//! The 32-byte directory entry structure parsed by [`classify`] is identical
//! on FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32. That part of this module would serve all three.
//!
//! [`enumerate_root`] is FAT32-only. On FAT12 and FAT16 the root directory is
//! a fixed-size region located immediately after the last FAT and sized by
//! `BPB_RootEntCnt`; there is no cluster chain to walk. FAT32 sets that field
//! to zero and stores the root directory as an ordinary cluster chain.
//!
//! The module is named for FAT rather than for directories generally because
//! chain walking is not shared beyond it.
//!
//! # What this does not do
//!
//! Long-filename entries are located, counted and kept in on-disk order.
//! They are not decoded. ADR-0007 section 5 records why, and section 5.3
//! records why the decision matters more for M6 than for M5.
//!
//! Short names are rendered only when every byte is printable ASCII. FAT
//! stores them in the OEM code page current when the entry was created, and
//! no code page information is recorded on the volume. Guessing one would
//! produce a name that looks authoritative and may be wrong.
//!
//! `DIR_NTRes` is recorded and not acted on. The specification instructs
//! readers to set it to zero on creation and never look at it afterwards,
//! while the tools that produced this project's fixtures write case flags
//! into it. Applying those flags would be an interpretation; recording the
//! byte preserves the evidence for a milestone that decides to.
