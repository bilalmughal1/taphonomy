# 0. Non-Negotiable Rules

These rules override every other instruction in this document.
They are not subject to interpretation, convenience, or exception.

## 0.1 Authorship and Attribution

Taphonomy is authored solely by Fahad Bilal Saleem.

Coding agents must never:

* add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer to any commit message
* add "Generated with", "Created by", "Assisted by", or any similar
  attribution to a commit message, pull request, code comment, documentation
  file, or file header
* name Claude, Claude Code, Anthropic, or any other AI tool anywhere in the
  repository's tracked content, commit history, or metadata
* claim, imply, or record authorship or co-authorship of any change

Any such attribution is a defect. If an agent is uncertain whether text
constitutes attribution, it must omit the text.

## 0.2 Version Control

All commits and pushes are performed manually by the author, in the terminal.

Coding agents must never run:

* `git commit`
* `git push`
* `git tag`
* `git merge`, `git rebase`, `git reset`, `git revert`, `git cherry-pick`
* `git filter-branch`, `git gc --prune`, or any history-rewriting command
* any command that contacts a remote

Coding agents may run read-only git commands such as `status`, `diff`, `log`,
`show`, `ls-files`, and `check-ignore`. They may run `git mv` only when
explicitly instructed, and must report the result.

An agent that believes a commit is required must stop and say so.

# Taphonomy Agent Instructions

## 1. Purpose

This repository contains Taphonomy, a local-first digital data recovery system.

Taphonomy is intended to become a serious engineering project that may eventually be used for personal data recovery and presented as professional engineering work.

Correctness, evidence preservation, security, reproducibility, and documentation take priority over development speed.

These instructions apply to Claude Code and any other coding agent operating in this repository.

---

# 2. Highest-Priority Rules

Before making changes, an agent must understand:

```text
docs/PROJECT.md
docs/SAFETY.md
SECURITY.md
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
```

If these documents conflict with an implementation request, stop and report the conflict.

Do not silently choose an unsafe interpretation.

---

# 3. Source Evidence Is Sacred

Never perform experiments against real user recovery evidence unless the user explicitly authorizes the exact operation.

Never assume that a mounted device is disposable.

Never assume that a device path identifies the same physical device throughout an operation.

Never write recovered output to the source.

Never format, repair, repartition, overwrite, or modify a source device during normal development.

---

# 4. Development Evidence

Development and testing must use controlled evidence.

Preferred test inputs are:

* synthetic disk images
* synthetic filesystems
* generated files
* intentionally corrupted fixtures
* disposable virtual disks
* controlled database fixtures
* known-good reference artifacts

Real personal data must not be committed to the repository.

---

# 5. Stop Conditions

The agent must stop and ask the user before proceeding when:

1. A command could modify a physical device.
2. A command could delete user data.
3. A command could overwrite evidence.
4. A command requires destructive filesystem operations.
5. The identity of a source device is ambiguous.
6. The identity of a destination is ambiguous.
7. An operation would transmit evidence over a network.
8. An external service would receive user data.
9. A security boundary would be weakened.
10. An architectural invariant would need to change.
11. A safety rule would need to change.
12. A dependency introduces a significant security or licensing concern.
13. The requested behavior cannot be implemented safely with the available evidence.

When uncertain, stop.

---

# 6. Never Fake Progress

The agent must never claim that functionality:

* works
* is safe
* is tested
* is accurate
* is production-ready
* supports a filesystem
* successfully recovered data

unless there is evidence supporting that claim.

Distinguish clearly between:

```text
Implemented
Tested
Experimentally validated
Partially supported
Untested
Known limitation
Planned
```

---

# 7. Research Before Implementation

Do not implement recovery algorithms based solely on assumptions.

For technically significant recovery functionality, research should establish:

* relevant specifications
* filesystem behavior
* storage behavior
* known limitations
* existing open-source implementations
* applicable standards
* platform-specific constraints
* expected failure modes

Research findings should be recorded in the appropriate documentation.

---

# 8. Existing Open-Source Software

Before implementing a major recovery capability, investigate existing mature projects where appropriate.

The goal is to learn from:

* established algorithms
* filesystem structures
* edge cases
* testing strategies
* failure handling
* limitations

Do not copy code without checking its license and compatibility with Taphonomy's license.

Do not reproduce large sections of third-party code merely because they appear useful.

Prefer:

```text
understand
→ evaluate
→ design
→ implement
→ test
```

over blind transplantation.

---

# 9. Architecture Discipline

Do not create abstractions without a demonstrated requirement.

Do not introduce:

* generic managers
* universal factories
* unnecessary service layers
* speculative plugin systems
* unnecessary databases
* unnecessary message buses
* unnecessary configuration systems

The architecture should remain understandable to one experienced engineer.

Prefer small, explicit components over abstraction for abstraction's sake.

---

# 10. Recovery Domains Must Remain Separate

The following domains must not be unnecessarily coupled:

```text
Removable Storage
HDD
SSD
Android
iOS
Application Artifacts
```

Shared infrastructure is allowed where the underlying behavior is genuinely shared.

A shared interface must not hide important technical differences between domains.

---

# 11. CLI Is an Interface

The CLI must not contain recovery algorithms.

The conceptual dependency direction is:

```text
CLI
 ↓
Application
 ↓
Domain
 ↓
Infrastructure
```

Recovery logic must be callable independently of CLI parsing.

This allows the same engine to be tested and eventually exposed through other interfaces.

---

# 12. Safety Before Optimization

Do not optimize recovery code before correctness is established.

The preferred development order is:

```text
Correctness
 ↓
Validation
 ↓
Safety
 ↓
Testing
 ↓
Measurement
 ↓
Optimization
```

Performance improvements must not silently change recovery results.

---

# 13. Evidence Access

Evidence must be accessed through controlled abstractions where practical.

Recovery algorithms should not directly manipulate arbitrary filesystem paths or physical devices.

The system should distinguish between:

```text
source
working evidence
analysis
recovery output
```

---

# 14. Error Handling

Do not ignore errors.

Avoid:

```text
catch and continue
```

when continuing could compromise correctness.

Errors should preserve enough context for diagnosis.

Differentiate between:

* expected absence
* malformed data
* unsupported format
* I/O failure
* permission failure
* device removal
* validation failure
* internal programming error

---

# 15. Panic and Crash Policy

Normal malformed evidence must not cause uncontrolled crashes.

For Rust code:

* avoid unnecessary `unwrap()`
* avoid unnecessary `expect()`
* handle recoverable errors explicitly
* use `Result` and `Option` appropriately
* document intentional panics
* isolate unsafe code

A parser must assume its input may be malformed.

---

# 16. Unsafe Code

`unsafe` code requires justification.

Every non-trivial unsafe block must document:

1. why unsafe behavior is necessary
2. the invariants required for correctness
3. why those invariants are satisfied

Do not introduce unsafe code merely for convenience or premature optimization.

---

# 17. Security

Treat all evidence as untrusted input.

Defend against:

* out-of-bounds access
* integer overflow
* integer underflow
* path traversal
* malicious filenames
* malformed metadata
* excessive allocations
* recursion exhaustion
* CPU exhaustion
* malicious compressed data
* symbolic-link attacks

See `SECURITY.md` for the complete security specification.

---

# 18. Source Modification

Before introducing any code capable of writing to a device, explicitly identify:

```text
What is being written?
Why is it necessary?
Can the operation be performed against an image instead?
What prevents the source from being selected accidentally?
What tests prove the protection?
```

Destructive functionality requires explicit architectural review.

---

# 19. Network Access

Do not introduce network communication into the recovery path without explicit approval.

Do not add:

* telemetry
* analytics
* cloud uploads
* remote recovery
* external AI processing
* automatic crash reporting

without documenting the security and privacy implications first.

---

# 20. Dependencies

Before adding a significant dependency, evaluate:

* purpose
* maintenance
* license
* security history
* transitive dependencies
* binary components
* required privileges
* network behavior

Do not add dependencies for functionality that can reasonably be implemented with existing project capabilities.

---

# 21. Documentation Is Part of the Implementation

A feature is incomplete when its required documentation is missing.

Documentation should explain:

* what was implemented
* why it was implemented
* important assumptions
* limitations
* safety implications
* testing performed
* known failures

Do not update documentation merely to claim that something works.

---

# 22. Architecture Decision Records

Create an ADR when a decision materially affects architecture.

Examples:

* programming language
* evidence representation
* filesystem abstraction
* image format
* major dependency
* storage model
* concurrency model
* plugin architecture
* mobile acquisition architecture
* security boundary

An ADR should explain:

```text
Context
Decision
Alternatives
Reasoning
Consequences
```

Do not create ADRs for trivial implementation choices.

---

# 23. Research Log

Research that materially affects implementation should be recorded in:

```text
docs/development/RESEARCH_LOG.md
```

Record:

* date
* subject
* sources
* findings
* implications
* confidence
* follow-up work

Research should be reproducible by another engineer.

---

# 24. Experiments

Experiments belong in:

```text
docs/development/EXPERIMENTS.md
```

An experiment should identify:

```text
Question
Hypothesis
Input
Method
Expected result
Actual result
Conclusion
Next action
```

Experiments must use controlled evidence.

---

# 25. Testing

Every meaningful implementation should have appropriate tests.

Tests may include:

```text
Unit tests
Component tests
Integration tests
Filesystem fixture tests
End-to-end tests
Property tests
Fuzz tests
Regression tests
```

Do not write tests that merely reproduce the implementation's own assumptions.

Tests should verify externally meaningful behavior.

---

# 26. Recovery Accuracy

Recovery testing must measure both:

```text
successful recovery
```

and:

```text
incorrect recovery
```

False positives are important failures.

A system that produces many plausible but incorrect files must not be considered accurate.

---

# 27. Reproducibility

Recovery experiments should record enough information to reproduce them.

Where applicable record:

* Taphonomy version
* fixture version
* input hash
* configuration
* recovery method
* expected result
* actual result

---

# 28. Git Discipline

Make focused commits.

A commit should represent one coherent change.

Avoid commits that mix:

```text
architecture changes
feature implementation
unrelated formatting
dependency changes
documentation rewrites
```

unless they are genuinely part of the same change.

Do not commit:

* secrets
* real user data
* recovery images
* generated binaries unless explicitly required
* temporary files
* personal credentials
* machine-specific configuration

---

# 29. Before Committing

Before recommending a commit, inspect:

```bash
git status
git diff
git diff --cached
```

Run the relevant tests and checks.

Do not stage files blindly.

Review the final diff.

---

# 30. Commit Messages

Commit messages should describe the actual change.

Preferred form:

```text
feat: add evidence reader abstraction
fix: reject out-of-bounds filesystem reads
test: add FAT32 deleted-entry fixtures
docs: record acquisition architecture decision
```

Do not use vague messages such as:

```text
updates
changes
stuff
fixes
work
```

---

# 31. No Premature Commit

Agents never commit, consistent with §0.2. All commits are made manually by
the author.

First:

```text
implement
→ inspect
→ test
→ review diff
→ document
→ propose commit
```

The user remains in control of the repository history.

---

# 32. No Destructive Git Operations

Do not execute destructive Git operations without explicit user approval.

Examples:

```text
git reset --hard
git clean -fd
git checkout -- .
git restore .
git push --force
```

If such an operation appears necessary, explain what would be lost and ask first.

---

# 33. Working Tree Preservation

Do not overwrite unrelated user changes.

Before modifying files, inspect the relevant working tree state.

If a file contains user changes unrelated to the current task, preserve them.

---

# 34. Code Quality

Prefer:

* explicit naming
* small functions
* narrow responsibilities
* strong types
* structured errors
* deterministic behavior
* clear interfaces
* meaningful tests

Avoid:

* giant files
* giant functions
* global mutable state
* magic constants
* duplicated recovery logic
* speculative abstractions
* hidden side effects

---

# 35. Comments

Comments should explain:

```text
why
```

rather than restating:

```text
what
```

Important safety invariants should be documented near the code they protect.

---

# 36. Generated Code

Generated code must be clearly identified.

Do not manually modify generated files if the project has a source-of-truth generator.

Generated output should not become the place where architecture is implemented.

---

# 37. Formatting

Use the official formatter for the chosen language.

Do not perform broad formatting changes unrelated to the task.

Avoid creating noisy diffs.

---

# 38. Platform Awareness

The initial development environment is:

```text
Windows
WSL2
Linux userspace
```

Do not assume that Linux behavior inside WSL is identical to native Linux hardware access.

Platform-specific behavior must be documented and tested separately.

---

# 39. CLI Safety UX

Commands capable of interacting with evidence must make the intended source and destination clear.

Dangerous ambiguity must produce an error.

The CLI should prefer:

```text
explicit failure
```

over:

```text
best guess
```

---

# 40. User Confirmation

Confirmation should be required for genuinely dangerous operations.

Do not add confirmation prompts to every harmless command.

The goal is meaningful protection, not confirmation fatigue.

---

# 41. Performance

Performance must be measured rather than guessed.

When optimizing, record:

* workload
* hardware
* Taphonomy version
* baseline
* optimized result
* memory usage where relevant
* correctness comparison

Never trade evidence integrity for an undocumented performance improvement.

---

# 42. Research Existing Recovery Software

When appropriate, inspect established projects such as:

* TestDisk
* PhotoRec
* The Sleuth Kit
* Autopsy
* Foremost
* Scalpel
* filesystem-specific open-source implementations

Use them as research references.

Their algorithms, licenses, assumptions, and limitations must be evaluated before adoption or adaptation.

---

# 43. Implementation Order

Do not begin by implementing every recovery domain.

The project should progress through controlled milestones.

Preferred progression:

```text
Repository foundation
        ↓
Documentation
        ↓
Development environment
        ↓
Evidence abstraction
        ↓
Synthetic test laboratory
        ↓
One narrowly defined recovery capability
        ↓
Validation
        ↓
Regression testing
        ↓
Additional capabilities
```

The first recovery capability should be selected based on research and testability, not perceived market value.

---

# 44. No Big-Bang Architecture

Do not create the complete final system before validating the first recovery path.

Architecture may evolve based on experimental findings.

When architecture changes:

```text
Research
→ ADR
→ implementation
→ tests
→ documentation
```

---

# 45. Completion Criteria

A task is not complete merely because code compiles.

Depending on the task, completion may require:

* implementation
* tests
* error handling
* documentation
* research references
* security review
* safety review
* reproducibility information
* changelog entry

The agent must state what was and was not completed.

---

# 46. Reporting Changes

After completing work, report:

```text
Changed
Tests run
Tests passed
Known limitations
Documentation updated
Security/safety considerations
Recommended next step
```

Do not bury important failures in a long summary.

---

# 47. If Something Goes Wrong

If an implementation introduces unexpected behavior:

1. Stop.
2. Preserve the current state.
3. Inspect the diff.
4. Identify the earliest known bad change.
5. Reproduce using controlled evidence.
6. Document the failure.
7. Fix the root cause.
8. Add a regression test.
9. Re-run the relevant test suite.
10. Update documentation if the architectural understanding changed.

Do not repeatedly patch symptoms without understanding the failure.

---

# 48. Final Rule

The agent must optimize for:

```text
correctness
+
evidence preservation
+
security
+
reproducibility
+
maintainability
```

before:

```text
speed
+
feature count
+
abstraction
+
convenience
```

If the safest action is to stop and ask the user, stop and ask.
